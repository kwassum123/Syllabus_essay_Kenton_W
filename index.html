    <h1>A Reflection on the Expetations of Being a Software Engineer and on the Syllabus</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Be a Pal</li>
        <p>Mayuko stresses in the video that soft skills are just as important or even more so important than technical skills. This was 
          dissonant with the preconceptual image of any tech dude or dudette I held in my mind; this being someone who works 80 hours a week
          in a pitch black office all the while being in some sort of semi-conscious daze with stray 1s and 0s clouding their peripheral
          vision. Outside of the cyber realm, it turns out that they're just normal people like you or me (well, maybe not me) and they
          actually leave their workspace to do human things like eat, sleep, socialize, and to 'ease nature' in receptacles other than 
          2-litres. The importance of soft skills and of working together are mirrored by the points of pairing up and helping your partners 
          in the syllabus. Helping others understand a concept that you think you know can, and probably will, teach you something about 
          the concept as well. My high school teachers drove me crazy every time they repeated the addage "you learn more as a teacher than
          you do as a student" but I realize more and more how right they are. Working together is a necessity as any one person most 
          likely doesn't have all of the answers. Having just a smidge of agreeableness can do wonders with makiung progress and problem 
          solving.</p>

        <li>Who Can be a Software Engineer?</li>
        <p><img src="hackerman (1).jpg" alt="hackerman" width="440" height="270" allign="right" />Well according to Mayuko, anyone really. You don't need to be a 'hackerman' with sunglasses from the 1990's, spikey hair with 
          half a tube of Xtra Hold<sup>TM</sup> gel globbed on, nor do you need a sick leather jacket aswell (see image to the right). Another one of my perceptions
          of someone who works in the technology industry is that they came out of the womb coding in Javascript and C++ on some sort of 
          in utero computer; this apparently isn't the case. The interviewer in the video says how kiddos would message him about how
          they think their absolutely screwed in their righteous quest to become tech gurus becasue they can't code at 16 and laughs at
          their petty woes. The syllabus accomodates us who aren't avatars of Steve Jobs as the objectives of this course use words such as
          "fundamental" and "core concepts." Detailed instructions on getting help from others and the professor as well as for requesting 
          accomodations are also so graciously bestowed upon us by our lord and master Dr. Bradshaw.</p>

        <li>Sugestion for an Addendum to the Syllabus</li>
        <p>If I may be so bold as to suggest an additional element to the most holy and sacred CSC 160 Syllabus and not be marked a heretic,
          I would suggest that the element of having fun be adhered. The goal of having fun is integral to the process of learning and not 
          experiencing boredom as a symptom. The class seems to be taught in a somewhat comedic fashion as it is so this shouldn't be 
          too much of a stretch.</p>
