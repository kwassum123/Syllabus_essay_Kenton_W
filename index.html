    <h1>A Reflection on the Expetations of Being a Software Engineer and on the Syllabus</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Be a Pal</li>
        <p>Mayuko stresses in the video that soft skills are just as important or even moire so important than technical skills. This was 
          dissonant with the preconceptual image of any tech dude or dudette I held in my mind; this being someone who works 80 hours a week
          in a pitch black office all the while being in some sort of semi-conscious daze with stray 1s and 0s clouding their peripheral
          vision. Outside of the cyber realm, it turns out that they're just normal people like you or me (well, maybe not me) and they
          actually leave their workspace to do human things like eat, sleep, socialize, and to 'ease nature' in receptacles other than 
          2-litres. The importance of soft skills and of working together are mirrored by the points of pairing up and helping your partners in the syllabus. Helping others
          understand a concept that you think you know can, and probably will, teach you something about the concept as well. My high school
          teachers drove me crazy every time they repeated the addage "you learn more as a teacher than you do as a student" but I realize
          more and more how right they are. Working together is a necessity as any one person most likely doesn't have all of the
          answers. Having just a smidge of agreeableness can do wonders with makiung progress and problem solving.</p>
        <li>Who Can be a Software Engineer?</li>
        <p>Well according to Mayuko, anyone really. You don't need to be a 'hackerman' with sunglasses from the 1990's, spikey hair with 
          half a tube of Xtra Hold<sup>TM</sup> gel globbed on, nor do you need a sick leather jacket aswell. Another one of my perceptions
          of someone who works in the technology industry is that they came out of the womb coding in Javascript and C++ on some sort of 
          in utero computer; this apparently isn't the case. The syllabus accomodates us who aren't avatars of Steve Jobs as the objectives
          of this course use words such as "fundamental" and "core concepts." Detailed instructions on getting help from others and the
          professor as well as for requesting accomodations are also so graciously given by our lord and master Dr. Bradshaw.</p>
