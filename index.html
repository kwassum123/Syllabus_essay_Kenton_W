        <p>Mayuko stresses in the video that soft skills are just as important or even moire so important than technical skills. This was 
          dissonant with the preconceptual image of any tech dude or dudette I held in my mind; this being someone who works 80 hours a week
          in a pitch black office all the while being in some sort of semi-conscious daze with stray 1s and 0s clouding their peripheral
          vision. Outside of the cyber realm, it turns out that they're just normal people like you or me (well, maybe not me) and they
          actually leave their workspace to do human things like eat, sleep, socialize, and to 'ease nature.' The importance of soft
          skills and of working together are mirrored by the points of pairing up and helping your partners in the syllabus. Helping others
          understand a concept that you think you know can, and probably will, teach you something about the concept as well. My high school
          teachers drove me crazy every time they repeated the addage "you learn more as a teacher than you do as a student" but I realize
          more and more how right they are.</p>
